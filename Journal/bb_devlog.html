		<p class="entry">Evidently I did not get the project finished in time for the first day back and the first day of the 3rd year of my degree. It's also been almost a month since I worked on it. Why? Work (money), moving house, commissions (money) etc. But the first chat with the tutors has revealed that I can make this the "mini" project I wanted it to be and nip it in the bud (yes..) and forget about it. Stu raised worries about it being too much of a technical project and something which is lacking in real design development and excitement&mdash;which is understandable, it pretty much is that. But in terms of development, the amount of Javascript I learnt doing this will prove to be very exciting for future projects. That, for me, is what a summer project <em>is</em>&mdash;an opportunity to learn a lot, technically.<br><br>I wont dwell, this project will be done soon.<br><br>Josh</p>

		<p class="entry">I knew it would change it a lot, but even just simple text as turned this random particle system thing into something somewhat informative and useful. Currently, the font I have gone for is <em>Letter Gothic Std Bold</em>, but I have a number of fonts under consideration. One of the joys of web-development is that fonts can be swapped and changed really quite easily. The fonts are:</p>

			<li>Clear
			<li>Readable
			<li>Contemporary
			<li>Adolescent
		</ul>
		<p class="entry">And I will add to that list as more buzzwords come to me. I'll play with the fonts in the actual thing (still, what exactly am I making?) itself and see what is best.<br><br>Josh</p>

		<p class="entry">I didn't finish this project by the end of August. But I feel I do have legitiamte reasons, I also think I can do a lot <em>this</em> week. Currently, I am to work on implementing the text which will work to explain what the particles are doing. The text from the <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/video/66117077">original video</a> is as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>THE BIG BANG [title]
				<li>It all starts with an infinitesimally tiny point of energy.
				<li>A trillion of which could fit on a pin-head.
				<li>[Arrows] All Energy, Nothing
				<li>Unstable conditions mean the energy can no longer be contained: The BIG BANG.
				<li>Energy fills space and time at extremely high speeds.
				<li>At such high temperatures and speeds, energy can turn into mass.
				<li>[E = MC^2]
				<li>Mass is either matter or antimatter.
				<li>Matter and antimatter attract, when they collide they annihilate one another.
				<li>...In a flash of energy.
				<li>Some particles with matter were leftover.
				<li>It is the leftover particles with mass, which go on to form the buildings blocks of the universe.
				<li>Gravity causes the particles with mass to attract one another and interact.
				<li>A vast sea of particles leads to areas of density, which creates a focal point attracting more particles.
				<li>Gradually the effects of gravity increases which squashes particles together creating some larger particles.
				<li>Systems begin to emerge which have an overall gravitational pull.
				<li>These systems go on to become larger systems like STARS.
				<li>The stars begin to interact to form larger systems again...
				<li>Like galaxies.
				<li>The universe is just a system of systems.
				<li>Made of nothing but matter, all originating from a very...
				<li>Big Bang!
			</ol>
		<p class="entry">A lot more than I remember making, I daresay I'll end up losing some of those, but that's fine, I am aiming for simplicity in this project. It could perhaps be shortened to:</p>
			<ol>

Although, ultimately, this project was always an excuse for me to learn a lot more about Javascript and about web development generally, it does still need to fulfil a purpose. The video above, I think, does this in a very simple way&mdash;simpler than what I am going for. It also goes into a lot more depth, and almost forces me to re-think my explanation of the Big Bang... The Big Bang is not exactly a simple thing, perhaps my simpler version could be targeted to children? Or as a primer to those interested in the Big Bang and physics&mdash;perhaps 11 to 15-year-olds in school?<br><br>Either way, as soon as I can, I need to really analyse how well the website functions and be concious of how well it does its job. Perhaps there could be some testing with a particular audience involved?<br><br>Josh</p>

		<h2>12. Full Screen &mdash; <time datetime="2013-08-28T14:28:16">28.08.13 &mdash; 14:28:16</time></h2>
		<img src="journal/img/11.png" alt="Full Screen"/><p class="entry">We are now full screen. It was surprising how much re-scaling the window messes with the code. In hindsight it shouldn't have been, because the particles are located and drawn in relation the the window itself, so of course, if you mess with the reference point, the mess with everything which uses that reference. Any way, working now. Next is to add the text elements which will do the actual explaining. The goal with that is to keep it as minimal an unobtrusive as possible.<br><br>Also there is now a fancy 'Fork Me' ribbon on the top-right of this page thanks to Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo">mojombo</a>) which he kindly shared <a href="https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons">here</a>.<br><br>Josh</p>

		<h2>11. Some Inspiration &mdash; <time datetime="2013-08-25T11:34:27">25.08.13 &mdash; 11:34:27</time></h2>
		<p class="entry">This has mainly been a technical log so far, so a note on some inspiration is in order. First of all <a href="http://hereistoday.com/" alt="Here Is Today">Here Is Today</a>.</p><img src="journal/img/09.png" alt="Here Is Today img"/><p class="entry"><em>Here Is Today</em> is a very simple web application written in JavaScript which puts into context the scale of time, using Today as the reference point. As the user clicks (only interaction), Today shrinks as it is engulfed by larger time-scales which are animated in. The interactive element is very simple, as is the animation, but I think therein lies its beauty. It does not really seek to explain much, merely contextualize time and it does so thanks to the simple UI.<br><br>Another similar website is <a href="http://htwins.net/scale2/" alt="The Scale of the Univers 2">The Scale of the Universe 2</a>.</p><img src="journal/img/10.png" alt="The Scale of the Universe 2"/><p class="entry"><em>The Scale of the Universe</em> again has very simple UI, a simple scroll bar which alters the scale of a number of objects which surround a human being&mdash;the reference point.<br><br>With my Big Bang app/website (I'm still not sure what I can call it) I want to do something similar. Keep the UI very simple, make the visuals interesting and engaging, but hopefully explain something through that. I do not intend to break down the Big Bang into every minute detail, just merely give the infamous Big Bang some sort of relevance to someone who knew nothing about it before&mdash;children included.<br><br>Josh</p>

		<h2>10. Not Far Off &mdash; <time datetime="2013-08-25T00:23:55">25.08.13 &mdash; 00:23:55</time></h2>
		<p class="entry">A comparatively very productive evening. After a week or so of most new implements going wrong, everything this evening worked first time. There is just one more feature to add, essentially the bones of the entire thing works now, as I initially intended it too&mdash;quite satisfying. I also said to myself (and I am now going to declare this here) that I would like to have this <em>finished</em> by the end of August. This was always meant to be a short project and I still intend it to be so. But I am on track for that any way.<br><br>Josh</p>

		<h2>9. More Progress &mdash; <time datetime="2013-08-22T01:13:57">22.08.13 &mdash; 01:13:57</time></h2>
		<p class="entry">Turns out the early decisions you make in the framework of your code severely affect the later development. I thought JSON would be a great way to store all the data needed for each state change, however accessing the data in a JSON file can be costly. I didn't really make use of JSON parsing which I'm sure I should have, but any way, I've swapped out the JSON for a simple switch-case setup. I've also eliminated the systems array and settled on just having one particle system, as I will hopefully only be dealing with that one particle system throughout.</p><img src="journal/img/08.png" alt="Attract All 2"/><p class="entry">One last side note, adding too many 'console.log()' statements, particularly in something which involves many calculations per frame can be the cause of slow frame rates and delays. That was one thing I learnt the hard way.<br><br>Josh</p>

		<h2>8. Progress &mdash; <time datetime="2013-08-21T14:57:54">21.08.13 &mdash; 14:57:54</time></h2>
		<p class="entry">Some progress was made today. The last physics based feature was implemented at works fine. The particles can now attract one another with their own gravitational pull. It does however pose some new problems, it involves the browser performing many calculation each frame and does slow the frame-rate down to around 20fps (from the desired 30fps) and it clearly noticeable. However, progress is progress.</p><img src="journal/img/07.png" alt="Attract All"><p class="entry"><br><br>Josh</p>

		<h2>7. Checking In &mdash; <time datetime="2013-08-19T23:33:49">19.08.13 &mdash; 23:33:49</time></h2>
		<img src="journal/img/06.png" alt="Constant flow"><p class="entry">This is largely me procrastinating. It's been a few days since I've updated this and little has changed really. I am getting better at identifying and fixing bugs in code which is good. But it's reached a stage where development is slow. However, the click-through state system is starting to work well. Each state does hold relevant information as I wanted it to and the click-through updates the current particles on screen. I am starting to realise the code is quite badly written and for it to be a truly efficient and speedy web-app the code will likely need a full overhaul. I'll see the project through and perhaps that can be Part II.<br><br>Josh</p>

		<h2>6. To Do &mdash; <time datetime="2013-08-14T12:38:52">14.08.13 &mdash; 12:38:52</time></h2>
		<img src="journal/img/05.png" alt="Loads"><p class="entry">After the hours wasted fixing such a small problem last night, I feel like now I need to bear such things in mind. One such thing is optimisation. This is an application (or whatever it is) which is to be displayed and used in a web browser which <em>has</em> to run in real time&mdash;so dealing with potentially thousands of particles each behaving independently will mean a lot of calculations the browser needs to perform per frame (currently at 30 frames per second). The above image shows 20 separate particle systems each dealing with 100 particles = 2000 particles. This particular example slowed the browser down considerably. Things to bear in mind:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Frame Rate</li>
			<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/optimizing-javascript" alt="JS Optimization">Class/Function definitions</a> (there are quite a few of those)</li>

		<p class="entry">I didn't sleep on it, I fucking fixed it. The problem was issues with <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/elixirtech.com/wiki/repertoire/report/working-with-scripts/additionandconcatenation" alt="addition and concatenation">addition and concatenation</a>. The values stored in the JSON are stored as strings, which naturally get concatenated, so they need to be converted to integers before they can be treated as integers. Of course it was a simple fix which didn't even require a single extra line of code. Now to back-track and repair all the extra damage I've done...<br><br>Josh</p>

		<p class="entry">This is a quick note to say what was a week or so of gradual progression, I have now reached my first major obstacle in the form of a bug. A bug which is making my console look like this:</p>
		<img src="journal/img/04.png" alt="fuuuuu-">
		<p class="entry">I can't for the life of me figure out what is causing it. I have been putting console.log()'s in all over the place, re-arranging functions, re-writing the vector object and other shit but I can't seem to fix it. At some point it is turning a simple round number into NaN (Not a Numer). I'll sleep on it.<br><br>Josh</p>

		<p class="entry">Particles are no long constrained to the canvas itself and can fly on and off the visible area&mdash;this will allow me to make the visible area full-screen. If the particle is off-screen it's "lifeSpan" begins to decrease (yet to spawn a new particle on it's death however). Now I must consider the order of states the particles will go through:
		<br><br><img src="journal/img/03.png" alt="Particle states">
		The particles will undergo change in:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Force</li>
			<li>Attraction to one-another - on/off</li>
			<li>Colour</li>
			<li>Size</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="entry">All these attributes will be stored in the JSON object/file and called upon for each state change.	The text to be overlaid will also be in the JSON object but I will return to this later.

		<h2>2. Where I Am Now &mdash; <time datetime="2013-08-12T13:06:44">12.08.13 &mdash; 13:06:44</time></h2>
		<p class="entry">The idea for this project was to return to a video I made which was an attempt to explain the Big Bang to be displayed on the moving-image posters found alongside the escalators on the London Underground:</p>
		<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/66117077" width="100%" height="702" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
		<p class="entry">
		The particles systems in this case were made in Processing, exported frame-by-frame and then recomposed in After Effects with text. I have since learnt a lot more in the way of web-development and so for this project I decided to try and recreate the same series of particle effects but in real-time with added interactive elements using Javascript and HTML5.<br><br>Progress has been reasonable and developments have been made daily. Currently the particle systems work efficiently and I can manipulate the forces applied (gravity, points of attraction, etc.). To gain a level of interaction I would like the forces to change but the particles to remain, rather than creating a new set of particles for each stage in the explanation&mdash;to create smoother transitions and to make it more fun to click through. In the picture below you can see that one of two forces can be added by clicking the buttons.
		</p>
		<img src="journal/img/01.png" alt="Clickable forces">
		<p class="entry">Now, I am beginning to added state-by-state transitions which click through one-by-one. The 'Change' button progresses to the next state. All states will be held in a JSON file, each state holding a list of forces to be applied, location and strength of attractors/repellors and so on. This means the particles currently on the canvas can be kept.<p/>

		<h2>1. Development Log &mdash; <time datetime="2013-08-12T12:58:32">12.08.13 &mdash; 12:58:32</time></h2>
		<p class="entry">I have decided to document the development of this project on this development log from now on. Working on an exclusively digital project means having a sketchbook to return to every-so-often hinders the speed at which I can work. To fully document the process I want to refer to research material and use imagery, and to print, cut and stick such things is time consuming. Although it has taken me an hour to get this how I want it to look and behave, I feel the time saved will get me that hour back and more. This is also something which can be turned into a physical object at the end of the project.<br><br>Josh</p>
