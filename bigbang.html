	<!--If you are looking at this, then hello. My name is Josh Murr and I made this as an excuse to learn a lot more Javascript and to play with
	particle systems. Use the code as you will, it is mainly adapted from Daniel Shiffman's code on particle systems from his book 'Nature of Code'
	which I would very much recommend. It is written for processing, but explained thoroughly which mean translating the code to JS was not hard
	at all. Hope it all makes sense...
