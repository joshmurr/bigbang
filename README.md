The Big Bang
=======

A Javascript based website which aims to explain the Big Bang using particle systems.

Most of the Particle System programming concepts come from Daniel Shiffman's *Nature of Code* book and this website is an experiment for me in transferring those concepts into JavaScript and HTML5.

You can follow the progress of the project on the [development log](http://www.joshmurr.co.uk/bb_devlog.html "Big Bag Devlog") I am keeping. This is ultimately a project that needs to be submitted as a university project, so the devlog is serving as my sketchbook to submitâ€”but it may be of interest to some of you.
