1. THE BIG BANG [title]
2. It all starts with an infinitesimally tiny point of energy.
3. A trillion of which could fit on a pin-head.
4. [Arrows] All Energy, Nothing
5. Unstable conditions mean the energy can no longer be contained: The BIG BANG.
6. Energy fills space and time at extremely high speeds.
7. At such high temperatures and speeds, energy can turn into mass.
8. [E = MC^2]
9. Mass is either matter or antimatter.
10. Matter and antimatter attract, when they collide they annihilate one another.
11. ...In a flash of energy.
12. Some particles with matter were leftover.
13. It is the leftover particles with mass, which go on to form the buildings blocks of the universe.
14. Gravity causes the particles with mass to attract one another and interact.
15. A vast sea of particles leads to areas of density, which creates a focal point attracting more particles.
16. Gradually the effects of gravity increases which squashes particles together creating some larger particles.
17. Systems begin to emerge which have an overall gravitational pull.
18. These systems go on to become larger systems like STARS.
19. The stars begin to interact to form larger systems again...
20. Like galaxies.
21. The universe is just a system of systems.
22. Made of nothing but matter, all originating from a very...
23. Big Bang!
